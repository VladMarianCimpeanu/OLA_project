Nowadays one big problem of e-commerces is to allocate the best price to its products so that,
the seller can maximize its revenue.
The main issue is that increasing the price of a product leads to less people interested in that product, thus
increasing the price is not necessarily beneficial to the seller, in contrast decreasing the price will increase the number
of people interested in the product, but the revenue will be of course suboptimal.
In order to do maximize the revenue we can analyze the demand curve of a given product which is
a graphical representation of the relationship between the price $p_i$ of a good or service $i$ and the quantity demanded $q_i(p_i)$
for a given period of time, and find the price $\hat{p}$ such that:
\begin{align*}
    \hat{p} = \argmax_p(pq(p))
\end{align*}
Unfortunately, in real world problems, the demand curve is not available, furthermore, we need to estimate this curve using
reinforcement learning techniques such as MAB (Multi Armed Bandit) algorithms.\\
In this project we want to study the case of a new e-commerce entering the market called ANS$^2$
