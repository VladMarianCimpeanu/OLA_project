Here we consider the case in wich all the parameters are known and and the goal is to maximize the cumulative expected reward, following a greedy approach.\\
The algorithm works as follow:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item set the prices of all the pruducts with the lowest one
    \item evaluate the marginal increase obtained by increasing the price of just one product
    \item compare the five different configuration obtained with the previous one. There could be two case\begin{enumerate}
        \item there is an increase of the reward, so select the one that gave the maximum reward (the highest increase) and repeat the algorithm from point 2
        \item there is no increse (all the new configuration is worst than the previous one) and stop the algoritm. 
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Return the actual best configuration.
\end{enumerate}
